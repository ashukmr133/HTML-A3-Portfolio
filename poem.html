            <p>I bid you goodbye,
                To a friendship in shambles,
                Rendering my peace a living hell.
                May you be blessed with happiness,
                May it have happiness
                But
                not on my account,
                Not on my accord,
                And not from my happiness.
                
                I release myself!
                The vicious cycle of uncertainty,
                The turn of events compounding to sadness,
                Stuck in the waves of unwavering tension
                Of unsaid words,
                Of unwritten letters,
                Of unspoken thoughts,
                They lie in my room,
                Beside me, on my bed,
                Quiet and quite undead.
                
                I bid you goodbye, good times,
                And the memories held in brevity.
                I bid you goodbye, bad times,
                I shall not be stuck in your gravity.
                Apologies and with guilt,
                Shall I be walking down the isle,
                Of the Hell,
                Watching you from the 9th ring,
                For you changed me,
                Or tried hard at it,
                And failed,
                And deprived me of honesty,
                And love!</p>

            <p>I wrote you a song,
                Not describing my love for you!
                Composed of the extensions of my words,
                I spent weeks, trying to describe you.
                
                I apologize,
                The song was shy, beautiful and in disarray.
                It had you and it didn't too,
                It had the rainbow and the multiple shades of grey.
                
                The song spoke of the clouds
                And oh! So common, yet rainfalls.
                Dark grey and at times, cotton white,
                They suffered from internal brawls.
                
                Light breeze and the fragrance of spring,
                The colorful flowers growing in the crack;
                Of the path that gets ignored everyday,
                Vibing brilliantly in the background so black.
                
                Pardon me,
                For I intended to describe your heart and soul.
                Pardon me,
                Describing nature wasn't my singular goal.
                
                I could not help but write,
                I could not help but compare my world,
                To you, carrying an air of self worth,
                For you,
                You, darling, are my world.
                
                The song has more of you, still,
                The pen, shameless, never stopped.
                Your actions spoke to my words,
                My heart beats were robbed.
                
                I speak, not of my love for you,
                But for you love for the flowers.
                Odyssey of your pain shows in your veins,
                Your tears were my rainy showers.</p>

        <br>
        <div style="border: .1px;background-color: aliceblue;border-style: double;">
            <p>The heart,
                The mind,
                The soul were lost.
                These lost synchrony of
                The beats,
                The moments,
                The tiny ripples in the veins,
                And the jump in the flow,
                For the heart skipped a beat
                When I saw you".
                
                " I couldn't love you anymore,
                Or did I ever begin to love you?
                The ripples were false alarms,
                But the rebound was true,
                It was you.
                Feeling safe in your arms,
                Charmed by your words,
                Mesmerised by your actions,
                The staycation extended.
                The unsaid words of your eyes,
                And the smile I brought to your face,
                I felt guilty for false hopes in your heart
                And the saturated dreams in your mind".
                
                "I couldn't love you anymore,
                Or I couldn't afford to love you.
                A life to build,
                To find an abode,
                Sources of happiness,
                Love, and emotions so new,
                I left you with stability and merry thoughts".
                
                " I couldn't love you anymore,
                For you never figured in my happiness.
                Making me feel happy was what you did,
                Yet, with no remorse, you failed.
                You could not fetch joy,
                A constant source.
                Hereby, darling,
                I leave you with my memory, that is,
                For I shall forget you and you,
                You stay strong and repent for us both,
                For I couldn't love myself anymore,
                Hoping you'd love us alone".
                
                "I couldn't love you anymore,
                But I have liked you a lot for the longest time.
                Walked on the beach,
                Thinking of you,
                Your silly jokes,
                Your immature ideas,
                Your internalised trauma,
                And how you coped.
                I look at the sky, I think of you,
                And of the stars,
                And again of you.
                We sleep under the same sky,
                Yet we wake up differently ",
                
                Said her, as she walked away,
                In a different world,
                To live under a different sky.</p>
